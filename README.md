# Comic Book Combat

An App that lets you pick two of your favorite Comic Book Characters and find out who would win in a fight

## App Summary

I made this app because comic book characters and Super Heroes has become a big part of pop culture and people always argue
about who would win in a fight between x character and Y character. This app gives people a reasonable answer to that question.
